    "The **N-BaIoT Dataset** is specifically designed to detect botnet attacks in Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Hereâ€™s a simplified explanation of the problem statement and the input features used in this dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement in Simple Terms\n",
    "The N-BaIoT dataset addresses the issue of **detecting malicious activities** (specifically botnet attacks) targeting IoT devices. As more devices connect to the internet, they become vulnerable to various cyber threats, including botnets that can take control of these devices to perform harmful actions. The goal of using this dataset is to develop machine learning models that can accurately identify when an IoT device is under attack, distinguishing between normal operation and suspicious behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Input Features in the N-BaIoT Dataset\n",
    "The dataset includes various features that represent the network traffic generated by IoT devices. These features are typically derived from the **network packets** and may include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Packet Size**: The size of the packets being sent or received.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Protocol Type**: Information about the communication protocol being used (e.g., TCP, UDP).\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Source and Destination IP Addresses**: The IP addresses involved in the communication, which can indicate the origin and target of the traffic.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Source and Destination Ports**: The ports used for communication, which can help identify specific services or applications.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Flow Duration**: The duration of the communication flow between devices.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Number of Packets**: The count of packets exchanged during a specific time frame.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Bytes Sent/Received**: The total amount of data sent or received during the communication session.\n",
    "\n",
    "These features help in analyzing the behavior of the IoT devices and detecting anomalies that may indicate a botnet attack. The dataset is structured to include both **normal traffic** (labelled as 0) and **attack traffic** (labelled as 1), allowing for supervised learning approaches to be applied in the detection of these anomalies.\n",
    "\n",
    "For further details, you can explore the dataset on platforms like Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mkashifn/nbaiot-dataset) or refer to the research publications associated with it.\n",
